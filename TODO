// Remarks:
// there are two formats of columns names in the sql fils:
	// 	* userid
	// 	* user_id
	// We should choose one formats


//Answer : let's choose the second one, cause I just change it on user's table

// pour afficher les posts que dois voir un utilisateur nous aurons besoin d'une requete qui regroupera
// les tables posts followers et almost users pour sortir les bonnes postes à montrer à l'utilisateur
