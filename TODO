// Remarks:
// there are two formats of columns names in the sql fils:
	// 	* userid
	// 	* user_id
	// We should choose one formats


//Answer : let's choose the second one, cause I just change it on user's table

// pour afficher les posts que dois voir un utilisateur nous aurons besoin d'une requete qui regroupera
// les tables posts followers et almost users pour sortir les bonnes postes à montrer à l'utilisateur

/*
like this below :

SELECT p.*
FROM posts p
LEFT JOIN followers f ON p.user_id = f.following_id AND f.follower_id = "userID of user who want to see the post"
LEFT JOIN almost_users au ON p.id = au.post_id AND au.authorize_users = "userID of user who want to see the post"
WHERE (
    p.privacy = 'public' OR
    (p.privacy = 'private' AND (f.follower_id IS NOT NULL OR f.following_id IS NOT NULL)) OR
    (p.privacy = 'almost' AND au.user_id IS NOT NULL)
);
